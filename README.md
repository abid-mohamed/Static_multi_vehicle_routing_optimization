# Static multi-vehicle routing optimization

This project is based on the ant colony algorithm to solve the static multi-vehicle routing problem for goods pick up and customer delivery, subject to time constraints and limited capacity of vehicles. 

The ant colony algorithm is a meta-heuristic algorithm which, inspired from the movement of natural ants, builds a colony of artificial agents of ants, in which each agent after building a candidate route solution, provides information (captured by the update of the pheromone level) about the path it traveled.
